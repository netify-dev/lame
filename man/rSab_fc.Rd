\title{Gibbs update for additive effects covariance}
\usage{
rSab_fc(a, b, Sab0=NULL, eta0=NULL, rvar=TRUE, cvar=TRUE, symmetric=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{vector of row random effects (additive sender effects)}

\item{b}{vector of column random effects (additive receiver effects)}

\item{Sab0}{prior (inverse) scale matrix for the prior distribution.
Default is diag(2), which provides a weakly informative prior.}

\item{eta0}{prior degrees of freedom for the prior distribution.
Default is 4, which is the minimum for a proper prior with 2x2 matrix.}

\item{rvar}{logical: should row variance be updated? (default TRUE)}

\item{cvar}{logical: should column variance be updated? (default TRUE)}

\item{symmetric}{logical: is this a symmetric network? (default FALSE)}
}
\value{
Updated covariance matrix Sab (2x2 matrix with variances on diagonal
and covariance off-diagonal)
}
\description{
Gibbs sampling for the covariance matrix of additive row and column
effects in the AME model. This function implements the inverse-Wishart
posterior update for the covariance matrix Sab.
}
\details{
The function implements different update strategies:
\itemize{
\item Full update: When both rvar and cvar are TRUE, updates the full 2x2
covariance matrix using an inverse-Wishart distribution
\item Row variance only: When only rvar is TRUE, updates only Sab\[1,1\]
\item Column variance only: When only cvar is TRUE, updates only Sab\[2,2\]
\item Symmetric case: When symmetric is TRUE, enforces equal variances
and high correlation (0.999) between row and column effects
}
