\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class "ame" or "lame" containing multiplicative effects,
or a network matrix Y if U and V are provided separately}

\item{Y}{Network matrix (only needed if fit is not provided)}

\item{U}{Matrix of sender latent factors (extracted from fit if not provided)}

\item{V}{Matrix of receiver latent factors (extracted from fit if not provided)}

\item{row.names}{Names for row nodes (defaults to rownames of Y or U)}

\item{col.names}{Names for column nodes (defaults to colnames of Y or V)}

\item{layout}{Character string specifying layout: "circle" (default) or "biplot"}

\item{vscale}{Scaling factor for V positions relative to U (default 0.8)}

\item{show.edges}{Logical; if TRUE, show network edges (default FALSE)}

\item{edge.alpha}{Transparency for edges (default 0.3)}

\item{node.size}{Size of nodes, or "degree" to scale by degree (default 3)}

\item{label.nodes}{Logical; if TRUE, show node labels (default TRUE)}

\item{label.size}{Size of node labels (default 3)}

\item{colors}{Optional vector of colors for nodes (e.g., for communities)}

\item{title}{Optional title for the plot}

\item{time_point}{For dynamic UV, which time point to plot (default: last).
Can be numeric index or "average" for time-averaged positions}

\item{plot_type}{For dynamic UV: "snapshot" (single time), "trajectory" (evolution),
"faceted" (grid of time points). For static UV, this is ignored.}

\item{show_arrows}{For trajectory plots, whether to show directional arrows}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object that can be further customized
}
\description{
Creates a two-dimensional visualization of the multiplicative effects (U and V)
from an AME or LAME model. These latent factors capture network structure
beyond what is explained by covariates and additive effects, including
clustering, transitivity, and other higher-order dependencies.
}
\details{
The multiplicative effects in AME models provide a low-rank representation
of network structure through latent factors:
\describe{
\item{U matrix}{Sender-specific latent positions (row factors)}
\item{V matrix}{Receiver-specific latent positions (column factors)}
\item{UV' product}{Captures dyad-specific effects beyond additive terms}
}

The visualization can show:
\describe{
\item{Circular layout}{Default layout placing nodes on a circle with
latent positions shown as deviations}
\item{Biplot layout}{Shows U and V positions directly in latent space}
\item{Network overlay}{Optional display of actual network ties}
}

Interpretation:
\itemize{
\item Nodes close together in latent space tend to have similar connection patterns
\item The distance between sender position (U) and receiver position (V) relates
to the likelihood of a tie
\item Clustering in the latent space indicates community structure
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit an AME model with multiplicative effects
fit <- ame(Y, X, R = 2)

# Basic visualization
uv_plot(fit)

# Show network edges
uv_plot(fit, show.edges = TRUE)

# Use biplot layout
uv_plot(fit, layout = "biplot")

# Color by known communities
uv_plot(fit, colors = community_membership)
}
