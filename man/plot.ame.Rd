\title{Plot comprehensive diagnostics for an AME model fit}
\usage{
\method{plot}{ame}(
  x,
  which = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  ask = FALSE,
  pages = c("single", "multiple"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class "ame" from fitting an AME model}

\item{which}{numeric or character vector specifying which plots to produce:
1 or "trace" = MCMC trace plots,
2 or "density" = posterior density plots,
3 or "gof" = goodness-of-fit plots,
4 or "effects" = additive and multiplicative effects.
Default is c(1,2,3,4) to show all plots.}

\item{ask}{logical; if TRUE, user is prompted before each plot page}

\item{pages}{character string specifying how to arrange plots:
"single" = one comprehensive page (default),
"multiple" = separate pages for each plot type}

\item{...}{additional arguments (currently not used)}
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly). Plots are displayed as side effects.
}
\description{
Creates a comprehensive set of diagnostic plots for an AME (Additive and
Multiplicative Effects) model, including MCMC diagnostics, parameter estimates,
and goodness-of-fit checks. This is the default plot method for AME objects.
}
\details{
The function produces a multi-panel plot containing:
\describe{
\item{MCMC trace plots}{Shows mixing and convergence of key parameters}
\item{Posterior distributions}{Density plots of regression coefficients
and variance components}
\item{Goodness-of-fit}{Comparison of observed network statistics to
posterior predictive distributions (if gof=TRUE in model fit)}
\item{Effect visualizations}{Plots of additive sender/receiver effects
and multiplicative effects if present}
}

The plot adapts to the model specification:
\itemize{
\item Shows only relevant variance components (e.g., omits cab for symmetric networks)
\item Includes multiplicative effects plots only if R > 0
\item Includes GOF plots only if computed during model fitting
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit an AME model
fit <- ame(Y, X, R = 2, gof = TRUE)

# Default comprehensive plot
plot(fit)

# Only MCMC diagnostics
plot(fit, which = c("trace", "density"))

# Only effects plots
plot(fit, which = "effects")

# Separate pages for each plot type
plot(fit, pages = "multiple")
}
