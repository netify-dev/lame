\title{Goodness of fit statistics}
\usage{
gof_stats(Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a relational data matrix (n x n square matrix) where Y\[i,j\]
represents the relationship from node i to node j. Missing values (NA)
are allowed and will be handled appropriately.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing five goodness-of-fit statistics:
\describe{
\item{sd.rowmean}{Standard deviation of row means. Measures the
heterogeneity in out-degree centrality (sender effects). Higher values
indicate more variation in how active nodes are as senders.}
\item{sd.colmean}{Standard deviation of column means. Measures the
heterogeneity in in-degree centrality (receiver effects). Higher values
indicate more variation in how popular nodes are as receivers.}
\item{dyad.dep}{Dyadic dependence/reciprocity correlation. Pearson correlation
between Y\[i,j\] and Y\[j,i\] across all dyads. Positive values indicate
reciprocity (mutual relationships), negative values indicate
anti-reciprocity. Range: \[-1, 1\].}
\item{cycle.dep}{Cyclic/transitive triadic dependence. Normalized sum of
products along three-cycles (i to j to k to i). Positive values indicate
transitivity clustering, where 'a friend of a friend is a friend'.
Based on the trace of the cubed centered matrix, normalized by the
trace of the cubed data availability matrix and the cubed standard deviation.}
\item{trans.dep}{Transitive triadic dependence. Normalized sum of products
along two-paths that close into triangles (i to j to k with k to i). Measures
the tendency for open triads to close. Based on the trace of the product
E*E'*E where E is the centered matrix, normalized appropriately.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates goodness of fit statistics for relational data matrices,
evaluating second-order (dyadic) and third-order (triadic) dependence
patterns. These statistics are useful for assessing model fit in
network analysis and relational data modeling.
}
\details{
The function computes network statistics that capture different aspects of
network structure beyond simple density. These statistics are particularly
useful for:
\itemize{
\item Model checking: comparing observed statistics to those from simulated networks
\item Model selection: choosing between models that better capture network dependencies
\item Descriptive analysis: summarizing key structural features of the network
}

Missing values in Y are handled by pairwise deletion for correlations and
are excluded from matrix products in triadic calculations.
