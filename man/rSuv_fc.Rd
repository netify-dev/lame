\title{Gibbs update for multiplicative effects covariance}
\usage{
rSuv_fc(U, V, Suv0=NULL, kappa0=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{matrix of multiplicative row effects (n x R matrix where n is the
number of nodes and R is the dimension of multiplicative effects)}

\item{V}{matrix of multiplicative column effects (n x R matrix)}

\item{Suv0}{prior (inverse) scale matrix for the prior distribution.
Default is identity matrix of dimension 2R x 2R, providing a weakly
informative prior.}

\item{kappa0}{prior degrees of freedom for the prior distribution.
Default is 2 + 2R, which is the minimum for a proper prior with a
2R x 2R covariance matrix.}
}
\value{
Updated covariance matrix Suv (2R x 2R matrix) for the stacked
effects \[U, V\]. The first R x R block contains covariances for U,
the last R x R block contains covariances for V, and the off-diagonal
blocks contain cross-covariances between U and V.
}
\description{
Gibbs sampling for the covariance matrix of multiplicative effects U and V
in the AME model. This function implements the inverse-Wishart posterior
update for the covariance matrix of the stacked UV effects.
}
\details{
The function updates the full covariance matrix for multiplicative effects
using an inverse-Wishart distribution. The posterior distribution is:
\deqn{Suv ~ IW(kappa0 * Suv0 + t(UV) \%*\% UV, n + kappa0)}
where UV = cbind(U, V) is the stacked matrix of effects.

This hierarchical prior allows for adaptive shrinkage of the multiplicative
effects, with the amount of shrinkage determined by the data through the
posterior update.
