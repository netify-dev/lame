\title{Validate input data format for lame function}
\usage{
check_format(Y, Xdyad=NULL, Xrow=NULL, Xcol=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a list of T network matrices, where T is the number of time periods.
Each element should be an n x m matrix representing the network at time t.}

\item{Xdyad}{an optional list of T dyadic covariates. Each element can be
either an n x m matrix (single covariate) or an n x m x p array (p covariates).
Must have the same length as Y if provided.}

\item{Xrow}{an optional list of T matrices of row/sender covariates.
Each element should be an n x pr matrix where pr is the number of row covariates.
Must have the same length as Y if provided.}

\item{Xcol}{an optional list of T matrices of column/receiver covariates.
Each element should be an m x pc matrix where pc is the number of column covariates.
Must have the same length as Y if provided.}
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE if all checks pass. Throws an error with an informative
message if any validation fails.
}
\description{
Internal validation function that checks the format and consistency of input
data for longitudinal AME models. Ensures that network data and covariates
are properly formatted as lists with consistent dimensions across time periods.
}
\details{
This function performs comprehensive validation of input data for longitudinal
network analysis, including:
\itemize{
\item Verifying Y is a non-empty list of matrices
\item Checking that all covariates (if provided) are lists of appropriate length
\item Validating data types for all elements
\item Warning about dimension inconsistencies across time periods
}

The function uses informative error messages via the cli package to help
users identify and correct data formatting issues.
}
\note{
This is an internal function primarily used by \code{lame()} but exported
for advanced users who want to validate their data before model fitting.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create example longitudinal network data
Y <- list(
  matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10),
  matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10),
  matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)
)

# Validate the data
check_format(Y)

# With covariates
Xrow <- list(
  matrix(rnorm(20), 10, 2),
  matrix(rnorm(20), 10, 2),
  matrix(rnorm(20), 10, 2)
)
check_format(Y, Xrow=Xrow)
