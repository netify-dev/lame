\title{Goodness of fit statistics for bipartite networks}
\usage{
gof_stats_bipartite(Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a bipartite relational data matrix (nA x nB rectangular matrix)
where Y\[i,j\] represents the relationship from node i in set A to
node j in set B. Missing values (NA) are allowed and will be handled
appropriately.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing bipartite-specific goodness-of-fit
statistics:
\describe{
\item{sd.rowmean}{Standard deviation of row means. Measures the
heterogeneity in out-degree from set A nodes (sender effects).
Higher values indicate more variation in how active A nodes are.}
\item{sd.colmean}{Standard deviation of column means. Measures the
heterogeneity in in-degree to set B nodes (receiver effects).
Higher values indicate more variation in how popular B nodes are.}
\item{four.cycles}{Count of four-cycles (also called 4-paths or squares) in
the bipartite network. A four-cycle occurs when two nodes from set A
(e.g., i and k) both connect to the same two nodes in set B (e.g., j and l),
forming a closed path: i->j->k->l->i. This measures the tendency for pairs
of A-nodes to share multiple common B-node connections, capturing a form of
clustering specific to bipartite networks. High four-cycle counts indicate
that connections are not random but show patterns of shared preferences or
co-occurrence. For example, in a user-item network, many four-cycles suggest
that users who like one item tend to also like other items that co-occur
with it.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates goodness of fit statistics specifically designed for bipartite
networks, evaluating degree heterogeneity and higher-order dependencies.
}
\details{
For bipartite networks, reciprocity and triadic closure are not meaningful
concepts since edges only exist between the two node sets. Instead, this
function focuses on:
\itemize{
\item Degree heterogeneity in both node sets
\item Four-cycles as the simplest higher-order dependence pattern
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a random bipartite network
Y <- matrix(rnorm(10*12), 10, 12)

# Calculate GOF statistics
gof_stats_bipartite(Y)
