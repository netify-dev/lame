\title{Plot comprehensive diagnostics for a LAME model fit}
\usage{
\method{plot}{lame}(
  x,
  which = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  time.points = NULL,
  ask = FALSE,
  pages = c("single", "multiple"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class "lame" from fitting a LAME model}

\item{which}{numeric or character vector specifying which plots to produce:
1 or "trace" = MCMC trace plots,
2 or "density" = posterior density plots,
3 or "gof" = longitudinal goodness-of-fit plots,
4 or "effects" = additive and multiplicative effects,
5 or "network" = network snapshots at selected times.
Default is c(1,2,3,4) to show main diagnostic plots.}

\item{time.points}{numeric vector of time points for network snapshots
(only used if "network" in which). Default is c(1, middle, last).}

\item{ask}{logical; if TRUE, user is prompted before each plot page}

\item{pages}{character string specifying how to arrange plots:
"single" = one comprehensive page (default),
"multiple" = separate pages for each plot type}

\item{...}{additional arguments (currently not used)}
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly). Plots are displayed as side effects.
}
\description{
Creates a comprehensive set of diagnostic plots for a LAME (Longitudinal
Additive and Multiplicative Effects) model, including MCMC diagnostics,
parameter evolution over time, and longitudinal goodness-of-fit checks.
This is the default plot method for LAME objects.
}
\details{
The function produces a multi-panel plot containing:
\describe{
\item{MCMC trace plots}{Shows mixing and convergence of key parameters}
\item{Posterior distributions}{Density plots of regression coefficients
and variance components}
\item{Longitudinal GOF}{Time series of observed network statistics with
posterior predictive intervals}
\item{Effects over time}{Evolution of additive effects across time periods
(if applicable)}
\item{Network snapshots}{Visualization of network at selected time points}
}

The plot adapts to the longitudinal structure:
\itemize{
\item Shows temporal trends in network statistics
\item Highlights composition changes if actors enter/exit
\item Displays credible intervals for time-varying statistics
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit a LAME model
fit <- lame(Y_list, X_list, R = 2)

# Default comprehensive plot
plot(fit)

# Only MCMC diagnostics
plot(fit, which = c("trace", "density"))

# Include network snapshots at specific times
plot(fit, which = c(3, 4, 5), time.points = c(1, 5, 10))

# Separate pages for each plot type
plot(fit, pages = "multiple")
