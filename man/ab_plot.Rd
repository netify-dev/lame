\usage{
ab_plot(
  fit,
  effect = c("sender", "receiver"),
  sorted = TRUE,
  labels = NULL,
  title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class "ame" or "lame" from fitting an AME model}

\item{effect}{Character string specifying which effect to plot:
"sender" (default) or "receiver"}

\item{sorted}{Logical; if TRUE (default), actors are sorted by effect magnitude}

\item{labels}{Logical; if TRUE, actor labels are shown on x-axis (default TRUE
for n <= 50 actors)}

\item{title}{Optional title for the plot}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object that can be further customized
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of the additive sender (row) and receiver (column)
random effects from an AME or LAME model. These effects capture heterogeneity
in actors' propensities to send and receive ties that is not explained by
covariates.
}
\details{
The additive effects in AME models represent:
\describe{
\item{Sender effects (a)}{Actor-specific tendencies to form outgoing ties.
Positive values indicate actors who send more ties than expected;
negative values indicate actors who send fewer ties.}
\item{Receiver effects (b)}{Actor-specific tendencies to receive incoming ties.
Positive values indicate actors who receive more ties than expected;
negative values indicate actors who receive fewer ties.}
}

The plot displays these effects as a dot plot with vertical lines extending
from zero to each effect estimate, making it easy to identify:
\itemize{
\item Which actors are most active/inactive as senders
\item Which actors are most popular/unpopular as receivers
\item The overall distribution and range of effects
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit an AME model
fit <- ame(Y, X)

# Visualize sender effects
ab_plot(fit, effect = "sender")

# Visualize receiver effects without sorting
ab_plot(fit, effect = "receiver", sorted = FALSE)

# Customize the plot
library(ggplot2)
ab_plot(fit) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("Network Sender Effects")
}
