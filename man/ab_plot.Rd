ab_plot(
  fit,
  effect = c("sender", "receiver"),

  title = NULL,
  time_point = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class "ame" or "lame" from fitting an AME model}

\item{effect}{Character string specifying which effect to plot:
"sender" (default) or "receiver"}

\item{sorted}{Logical; if TRUE (default), actors are sorted by effect magnitude}

\item{labels}{Logical; if TRUE, actor labels are shown on x-axis (default TRUE
for n <= 50 actors)}

\item{title}{Optional title for the plot}

\item{time_point}{For dynamic effects, which time point to plot (default: last).
Can be numeric index, "all" for faceted plot, or "average" for time-averaged}

\item{plot_type}{For dynamic effects: "snapshot" (single time), "trajectory" (evolution over time),
"faceted" (grid of time points), or "ribbon" (confidence bands over time).
For static effects, this parameter is ignored.}

\item{show_actors}{Character vector of specific actors to highlight (for dynamic trajectory/ribbon plots)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object that can be further customized
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of the additive sender (row) and receiver (column)
random effects from an AME or LAME model. Automatically detects whether effects
are static or dynamic and provides appropriate visualization options.
}
\details{
The additive effects in AME models represent:
\describe{
\item{Sender effects (a)}{Actor-specific tendencies to form outgoing ties.
Positive values indicate actors who send more ties than expected;
negative values indicate actors who send fewer ties.}
\item{Receiver effects (b)}{Actor-specific tendencies to receive incoming ties.
Positive values indicate actors who receive more ties than expected;
negative values indicate actors who receive fewer ties.}
}

For static effects, the plot displays these effects as a dot plot with vertical
lines extending from zero to each effect estimate.

For dynamic effects (when fit contains a_dynamic/b_dynamic), additional options
are available to visualize how effects evolve over time.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit an AME model
fit <- ame(Y, X)

# Visualize sender effects
ab_plot(fit, effect = "sender")

# Visualize receiver effects without sorting
ab_plot(fit, effect = "receiver", sorted = FALSE)

# Customize the plot
library(ggplot2)
ab_plot(fit) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("Network Sender Effects")
}
