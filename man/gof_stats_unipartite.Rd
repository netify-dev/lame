\title{Goodness of fit statistics for unipartite networks}
\usage{
gof_stats_unipartite(Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{a square n x n relational data matrix where Y\link{i,j} represents the
relationship from node i to node j. Missing values (NA) are allowed and will
be handled appropriately. Diagonal values are typically NA for non-self-loop networks.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing five goodness-of-fit statistics:
\describe{
\item{sd.rowmean}{Standard deviation of row means. Measures the
heterogeneity in out-degree centrality (sender effects).}
\item{sd.colmean}{Standard deviation of column means. Measures the
heterogeneity in in-degree centrality (receiver effects).}
\item{dyad.dep}{Dyadic dependence/reciprocity correlation. Measures the
correlation between Y\link{i,j} and Y\link{j,i}, capturing reciprocity patterns.}
\item{cycle.dep}{Cyclic triadic dependence. Measures the tendency for
directed cycles (i->j->k->i) in the network.}
\item{trans.dep}{Transitive triadic dependence. Measures the tendency for
transitivity (if i->j and j->k, then i->k) in the network.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates goodness of fit statistics specifically for unipartite (square) networks,
evaluating second-order (dyadic) and third-order (triadic) dependence patterns.
}
\details{
This function computes network statistics that capture different aspects of
network structure beyond simple density. These statistics are particularly
useful for evaluating how well a model captures the observed network patterns.

The dyadic dependence statistic captures reciprocity - the tendency for
relationships to be mutual. The triadic statistics capture different forms
of triadic closure that are common in social networks.

Missing values in Y are handled by pairwise deletion for correlations and
are excluded from matrix products in triadic calculations.
