\usage{

\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class "ame" or "lame" containing GOF statistics}

\item{type}{Character string: "auto" (default), "static", or "longitudinal".
If "auto", determined by model class.}

\item{statistics}{Character vector specifying which statistics to plot.
Default is all four: c("sd.row", "sd.col", "dyad.dep", "triad.dep")}

\item{credible.level}{Numeric between 0 and 1; credible interval level for
longitudinal plots (default 0.95)}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for faceted plot layout (default 2)}

\item{point.size}{Size of points in longitudinal plots (default 2)}

\item{line.size}{Width of lines in plots (default 1)}

\item{title}{Optional title for the plot}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object that can be further customized
}
\description{
Creates diagnostic plots comparing observed network statistics to their
posterior predictive distributions. This helps assess whether the model
adequately captures important network features.
}
\details{
The function evaluates model fit using key network statistics that vary by network type.

For unipartite networks:
\describe{
\item{Standard deviation of row means}{Captures variance in out-degree/activity}
\item{Standard deviation of column means}{Captures variance in in-degree/popularity}
\item{Dyadic dependence}{Correlation between dyads (reciprocity)}
\item{Triadic dependence}{Transitivity/clustering in the network}
}

For bipartite networks:
\describe{
\item{Standard deviation of row means}{Captures variance in activity from set A}
\item{Standard deviation of column means}{Captures variance in popularity in set B}
\item{Four-cycles}{Count of 4-node closed paths where pairs of A-nodes share
multiple B-node connections, measuring clustering in bipartite networks}
}

For static models (AME), the function produces histograms comparing the observed
statistic (red line) to the posterior predictive distribution.

For longitudinal models (LAME), the function produces time series plots showing
the observed statistics over time with posterior predictive intervals.

Good model fit is indicated when:
\itemize{
\item Observed values fall within the posterior predictive distributions
\item No systematic deviations across statistics
\item For longitudinal models, observed values track within the credible bands
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit an AME model
fit_ame <- ame(Y, X, gof = TRUE)

# Basic GOF plot
gof_plot(fit_ame)

# Plot only degree-related statistics
gof_plot(fit_ame, statistics = c("sd.row", "sd.col"))

# Fit a LAME model
fit_lame <- lame(Y_list, X_list)

# Longitudinal GOF plot with 90\% credible intervals
gof_plot(fit_lame, credible.level = 0.90)
}
