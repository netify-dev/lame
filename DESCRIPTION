Description: An extension of the 'amen' package specifically designed for 
    longitudinal network analysis. Provides tools for fitting Additive and 
    Multiplicative Effects (AME) models to longitudinal/replicated relational 
    data with key enhancements including: (1) robust handling of changing actor 
    compositions across time periods, allowing for networks with different sets 
    of actors at each time point; (2) significant performance improvements through 
    C++ implementations of computationally intensive operations via Rcpp and 
    RcppArmadillo; (3) specialized functions for temporal network dynamics and 
    time-varying covariates. Supports various data types including binary networks, 
    continuous relations, ordinal data, and fixed-rank nominations. The package 
    maintains compatibility with the original 'amen' framework while offering 
    enhanced capabilities for panel and time-series network data.
