Description: An extension of the 'amen' package for longitudinal network analysis. Provides tools for fitting Additive and Multiplicative Effects (AME) models to longitudinal/replicated relational data with enhancements including: (1) Dynamic effects modeling where both additive (sender/receiver) and multiplicative (latent factor) effects evolve over time via AR(1) processes, enabling analysis of temporal heterogeneity in network structure and individual behavior (Sewell & Chen 2015 <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.988214>, Durante & Dunson 2014 <doi:10.1093/biomet/asu040>); (2) Handling of changing actor compositions across time periods, allowing for networks with different sets of actors at each time point; (3) Performance improvements through C++ implementations via Rcpp and RcppArmadillo; and various additional (4) Plotting functions. The dynamic effects implementation uses forward-filtering backward-sampling (FFBS) for temporal updates and includes priors for temporal persistence (rho) and innovation variance (sigma^2) parameters.
