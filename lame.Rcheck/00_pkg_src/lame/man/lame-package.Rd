\title{Longitudinal Additive and Multiplicative Effects Models for Networks}
\description{
An extension of the 'amen' package specifically designed for longitudinal
network analysis. This package provides tools for fitting Additive and
Multiplicative Effects (AME) models to longitudinal/replicated relational
data with several key enhancements: (1) robust handling of changing actor
compositions across time periods, allowing for networks with different sets
of actors at each time point; (2) significant performance improvements through
C++ implementations via Rcpp and RcppArmadillo; (3) specialized functions for
temporal network dynamics. The package supports various data types including
binary/network data (bin), normal relational data (nrm), ordinal relational
data (ord), censored binary data (cbin), fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn),
and row-ranked data (rrl). Based on the AME framework originally developed
by Hoff (2009) and Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and Stovel (2013).
